	<p>Bedok Reservoir has the largest fishing area. There are some structures and floating devices littered across the reservoir as you walk along the legal fishing area. There is little chance to snag your line if you are fishing near the fishing deck and floating platforms. However, along the water line, there are large rocks near the ‘coast’, be a little more attentive if you are using smaller lures.</p>

	<p>You can fish along the blue areas as depicted on the map above. There are signs and instructions located on site as well.</p>

<br>
	<b>Fish Responsibly</b>  
	<p>Reservoirs and waterways are common spaces to be shared among various users. When fishing, please abide by PUB’s rules and regulations below:</p>
	<p>1) Fish only at designated areas</p>
	<p>2) Use only artificial bait at reservoirs and waterways</p> 
	<p>Those caught violating fishing regulations may be fined up to $3,000.</p>

<br>

	<b>Be Considerate</b>  
	<p>Exercising a little consideration goes a long way in making our reservoirs and waterways a safe and pleasant environment for all to enjoy.</p>

	<p>1) Cast lures with care to avoid injuring others</p> 
	<p>2) Fly fishing is not allowed </p>
	<p>3) Give way to pedestrians using the same pathway </p>
	<p>4) Use only carbon steel micro barb or barbless hooks and practice catch and release where possible</p>
	<p>5) Discard unwanted fishing lines, hooks and other rubbish into litter bins</p>
	<p>6) Otters may be spotted. Do not harm them</p>
	<p>7) Children should be accompanied by adults</p>
